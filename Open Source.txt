   I had never used GitHub before, but now that I have, I find it really beneficial for learning about free and open-source software.It's great for storing projects and files, inviting others to contribute with the project, creating branches, generating issues, and more. Now I want to enhance my knowledge of GitHub so that I can use it more effectively in the future. I think it's incredibly useful for projects, and I'm disappointed I didn't utilize it sooner since it would have addressed a lot of problems and allowed me to contribute to projects online, among other things and be expart.\\
